To run the game, click on the MainMenuGUI and run it, ignore the message. To play the gameplay, open the gamePlayGUI. When opening screens, make sure to minimize instead of closing them to make sure you do not accidentally close the entire game. In all, the game should run perfectly fine. If it works fine, you can start the gameplay from the MainMenuGUI after clicking on New Game and entering your username and password. Of course, you must have JUnit5 to test the tester files.
